# Algorithms & Data Structures

I created this repo to create an open source set of algorithms and data structures helpful for technical interviews. I try to have at least two languages from C, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

- Interview Questions holds popular algorithmic questions
- Data Structures holds physical and logical structures
- Sorting Algorithms holds the most common sorting algorithms

## Running locally

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3
- GCC
- Node.js

I use the `time` command (macOS) to compare the different languages after analyzing their time and space complexities.

For example, I compile the C file then run all three files with time:

```bash
gcc filename.c
time ./a.out
time node filename.js
time python3 filename.js
```
