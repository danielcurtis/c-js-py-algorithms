# C, JavaScript & Python Algorithms

I created this repo to share my solutions of common algorithm questions.

I decided to solve them using the three languages I know best: C, JavaScript, and Python. I typically solve the problem in JavaScript first and optimize it. Then I move onto Python, and then C to think more about the data structures more critically.

## Technologies

- Python 3
- gcc
- Node

## Running locally

I like to use the `time` command to run the files. While it's not perfect, it gives a good indicator. Unsurprisingly, C always beats Python and JavaScript.
For example, I compile the C file then run all three files with time:

```bash
gcc filename.c
time ./a.out
time node filename.js
time python3 filename.js
```
